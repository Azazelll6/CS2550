--EXTRA CREDIT COMPLETED--
FLOATING DIV (5pts)    YES
STRIPED TABLE (5pts)   YES
MODAL PORTRAIT (10pts) YES
ARTISTIC MERIT (10pts) YES: Add description of what you did

Use a special font (see the “Bonus work” section, below).
One way is to create a CSS class for <h1>, and set the background-image The background image will appear only within
 the rectangular space for the <h1>.
Instead of using an <h1>, create an image that has your name and whatever background you like. Put the <img> element
 at the top of your page.

image
You can see the face clearly, and it looks lifelike.
Not blurry.
Not pixelated.
No jpeg artifacts.
Round things look round (not egg-shaped).
Well-lit. Not too bright or dark.  Good contrast.  Not washed out.
Your <img> element may use only the following attributes:

src (for obvious reasons)
class
alt
title

Headings should be called out visually, just like your name.

Use the margin property to set the space above or below each heading. If you don’t know what to do,
make sure each heading has an upper margin of 75% of the heading’s font size, and a lower margin of
10%-33% of the heading’s font-size.  Do not use extra blank paragraphs or <br> elements.

Class schedule (25 points)
Get rid of the border property on your <table> element. You don’t need this anymore.  If you want your
 table to have borders, use CSS.
Each of the items on your schedule should have its own background color. See the sample document for
 how to do this.  You can get this to work by defining a class for each item on your schedule.
 In my example I used the background-color and border-color properties, and I picked a border color
 that was slightly darker than the background.  I also set the border-style to solid.
The column widths for each day of the week should be equal. You should be able to do this
without adding line-breaks to the text in your <td> elements, or shortening the text.  There is
a number of ways you can do this.  I got it to work by:
Make a CSS class for the <table> element, and set the following properties:
table-layout: fixed
width: (whatever you want. 600px-900px should be fine)
Make a CSS class for each <th> element, and set its width Start with 120px, and play with it till it
 looks good.
In addition, you can also try any combination of the following:

Make the header different from the rest of the table. Change the text alignment, the font colors,
 the background color, etc.  The default centered behavior you get with <th> almost never looks good.
Use the padding property to add cell padding so that the text isn’t crammed against the cell borders.
Get rid of cell spacing on the <table> element, by setting
border-collapse: collapse;
border-spacing: 0;
Use the border-bottom property and border-color property to draw lines across your table on each
 30-minute mark. Pick a light color so that the lines are visible but not too strong.
Put a border around the outside of the table.
Tweak the horizontal or vertical alignment using the text-align and vertical-align
Think of something else. Be creative.
Add a background graphic for the entire table. You will have to play with this to get it to look right.
 If this doesn’t look good, I won’t be impressed.

Extra Credit Work (20 points max)
You may do up to four of the following for up to 20 points of extra credit.  These topics are your responsibility
 to learn (remember, Google is your friend).

(5 points) Embed your document in a centered <div> that floats over a fixed background, like so:
 http://forgefire.blogspot.com/Links to an external site.. (this is easier than you think).
(5 points) in your class schedule, do alternating striped colors for each row, or for each column (not both).
Here’s an article on how to do that: https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/evenodd.en.htmlLinks to an external site..
You should have a third color for the table header.
(5 points) CSS3 Web Fonts. W3Schools has an in-depth article on this.
You can use fancy fonts for your name at the top of the page, and for the section headings.
If you do a special font for your body text, it must be a font that is easy to read. Please don’t make my eyes bleed.
 No fancy script fonts, gothic-style fonts, etc.
(10 points) If you click on your portrait, have a larger version appear in a modal <div> (like what Facebook or
 Twitter does). You’ll need JavaScript to do this, but if you search the web you can find lots of examples on how
  to do this.  Requirements:
There should be a close-box in the upper left.
Clicking the close box or clicking anywhere outside the image should make the modal <div> disappear.
While the modal <div> is visible, the page in the background should appear darkened or blurred.
(10 points) artistic merit. Wow me.  Think outside the box with the page’s layout, do something totally bold.
Put each section in its own floating div. Have each div offset from the left margin or centered horizontally.
Make use of side-bars
Have a header that stays fixed on the page.
It can’t just be one thing (that’s what we call a gimmick). Totally re-arrange your paradigm, but above all,
 make it attractive.

    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>Family is the cornerstone of my life. Every day with my wife and our spirited two-year-old is a fresh chapter in our story, filled with laughter, sometimes a dash of chaos, but always love. The moments I get with them are the number one thing I look forward to every day, without fail.</p>
        <p>Learning, at first was a tedious chore for me pre-college. But after finally deciding to pursue higher learning it has quickly become one of my passions. Whether I'm diving into the complexities of game design, mastering the nuances of software development, or exploring the latest in machine learning, each discovery propels me forward. My curiosity leads me through the vast landscape of knowledge, ensuring that with each step, I grow not only in expertise but also as a person, eager to share and apply what I've learned.</p>
        <p>Drawing is a quiet hobby of mine, a way to unwind after a long day. Slowly scratching out a world or person one line at a time. I always loved how satisfying it is to shape a blank piece of paper and bringing life into it's empty edges.</p>
