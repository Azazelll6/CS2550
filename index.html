<!--
WEB SITE ELEMENTS -  site should include the following elements:
Overall Layout  (Required)
Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for your overall layout, columns, rows, alignment etc.  It is a best practice to use CSS Grid for your overall layout, and Flexbox for layout within the site containers.

HTML 5 Semantic Tags for your entire layout:

main, header, section, article, nav, aside, footer, figure, figcaption, detail

I recommend you start with just the main container tags for your application and then add content after they are placed and working as you desire.  Put a background and border on them so you can visualize your layout as you put your CSS Grid and Flexbox containers together.
Home Page  (Required)
Home page gives a nice one page display of your topic of interest
Should include:
At least four different areas on the page, e.g,
header
Menu (aside)
Main Content
Footer
Header (Required)
Should have an image/logo and a title of some sort.
You could place your menu in the header if you so choose.
Menu (Required)
Create a menu and place it in a <nav> element in either the header, or an aside to left of main content
This could be a menu which uses  'pills' (buttons), or just plain <a> links.
Menu can be vertical or horizontal
Menu has a minimum of three links to different 'sections' of your site, for example:
Home -  Link which shows your Home Page content
Contact - Link which shows your contact information
???   - link to pages which might contain more detailed information and subsections of your site
Menu actions will hide/show the different sections each whose main content is in tab-panes', one at a time.
Section Content
Hiding/Showing Content (Required)
Implement implement each section of your site into separate <section> elements
Hide all of the elements except for the 'Home' page using the 'display:none' style
These are likely contained in <section> tags  One will be set to 'display:none' to start off with.
You will use javascript to hide and show these sections as you click on the menu items or pills.
Images
Your page must contain images (required)
At least one with a caption
You should enclose this in a 'Figure' html5 tagLinks to an external site., which also includes a figcaption tag.  (required) (-2 if missing)
Extra Credit  (+2) Utilize a 'picture' tag with child 'source' tags which show different images based on media query.
Video (required)
Embed videos of interest on  your topic
Overall Considerations
Responsiveness (Desktop/Tablet)
Your CSS Grid and  flexbox layout and css should make your profile look nice on both a large desktop as well as a tablet.
Use media queriesLinks to an external site. to optimize layout at smaller/tablet size (approximately 768 pixels wide)
Styling
You should utilize your CSS skills to make your site LOOK NICE!   Use colors, gradients, background images, drop shadows,  images, icons etc. to enhance the look and feel of your site.
