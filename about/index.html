            <p id="haiku-inspiration">I love reading books, and since we were listing my favorite books I decided to combine the two and write a haiku about my love of books.</p>
            <div id="haiku">
                <h3 id="haiku-title">Adventure's Call</h3>
                    <p id="haiku-body">Books are my escape<br>
                    They take me to other worlds<br>
                    Where adventure awaits</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">My Personal Interests</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Family is the cornerstone of my life. Every day with my wife and our spirited two-year-old is a fresh chapter in our story, filled with laughter, sometimes a dash of chaos, but always love. The moments I get with them are the number one thing I look forward to every day, without fail.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Learning, at first was a tedious chore for me pre-college. But after finally deciding to pursue higher learning it has quickly become one of my passions. Whether I'm diving into the complexities of game design, mastering the nuances of software development, or exploring the latest in machine learning, each discovery propels me forward. My curiosity leads me through the vast landscape of knowledge, ensuring that with each step, I grow not only in expertise but also as a person, eager to share and apply what I've learned.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Drawing is a quiet hobby of mine, a way to unwind after a long day. Slowly scratching out a world or person one line at a time. I always loved how satisfying it is to shape a blank piece of paper and bringing life into it's empty edges.</p>
